# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

When you type "google.com" in your browser and hit Enter, a fascinating journey begins to bring the Google search page to your screen. Here's what happens step by step in a way that's easy to understand:

1. Finding Google's Home (DNS Request):

Imagine you're looking for a friend's house. Your browser needs to find Google's "home" on the internet. It sends a request to something like an address book called DNS. This address book tells your browser the exact location (IP address) of Google.
2. Knocking on Google's Door (TCP/IP):

Now that your browser has the address (IP address), it knocks on Google's "door." This is done through a secure internet doorbell called TCP/IP. It's like making sure you have a solid connection to your friend's place before you start talking.
3. Security Check at the Door (Firewall):

Before entering, there's a security check at the "door." This is like a security guard checking your invitation at a party. The firewall makes sure everything is safe and sound before your browser goes in.
4. Secret Handshake for Safety (HTTPS/SSL):

To keep the conversation private, your browser and Google do a secret handshake called SSL/TLS. It's like speaking in a secret code only you and your friend understand. This keeps everything between you and Google private and secure.
5. Traffic Cop Directing Visitors (Load Balancer):

Google is a popular place, and lots of people are trying to visit. A friendly traffic cop called a load balancer helps manage the crowd. It makes sure everyone gets in smoothly without anyone getting stuck.
6. Getting the Menu (Web Server):

Your browser finally steps into Google's place and asks for the "menu" (webpage). The chef, known as the web server, prepares the menu for you. This includes all the words, pictures, and links you see on the Google search page.
7. Special Chefs for Special Requests (Application Server):

Sometimes, you want something special from the menu. For example, when you search for "cute puppies," there's a special chef called the application server that helps find the cutest puppy pictures just for you.
8. Searching in the Library (Database):

To find the special dishes, the application server might need to search in a big library of information called a database. It's like looking in a giant book of all the web pages and pictures Google knows about.
9. Bringing the Tray to Your Table (Response):

Once everything is ready, the chef (web server) puts all the delicious dishes (webpage content) on a tray. This tray is handed to your browser as a response. It's like a waiter bringing your food to your table.
10. Putting It All Together (Rendering and Display): - Now, your browser takes the tray of dishes and arranges everything on your table. It's like putting together a puzzle, making sure all the words, pictures, and links are in the right place. Finally, you see the Google search page on your screen!

In a nutshell, it's a bit like finding a friend's house, knocking on their door, making sure everything is safe, having a private conversation, managing the crowd, getting the menu, asking for special dishes, searching in a big library, bringing the tray to your table, and finally, enjoying your meal. That's how your browser brings the Google search page to your screen!
